#structured _programming_basics/power.c
This C program calculates the power of a number (x) raised to another number (y). Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:

It starts by prompting the user to input the values of x and y.
It reads the input values of x and y from the user.
If the value of y is negative, the program immediately stops and returns -1.
If y is non-negative, the program calculates x raised to the power of y using the pow function from the math.h library.
Finally, it prints the result of x raised to the power of y to the console.
That's it! The program essentially takes two numbers as input, checks if the second number is non-negative, and then calculates the power of the first number raised to the second number.

#structured_programming_basics/pyramid.c
 This C program generates a pattern of numbers in a pyramid shape. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:

It prompts the user to enter the number of rows for the pyramid.
It reads the input number of rows from the user.
It uses nested loops to generate the pyramid pattern:
The outer loop (for i) iterates through each row of the pyramid, from 1 to the specified number of rows.
The first inner loop (for space) prints spaces to create the left-side alignment of the pyramid. The number of spaces decreases with each row to create the pyramid shape.
The second inner loop (for symbol) prints the numbers in the pyramid pattern. The number of symbols increases with each row, following the pattern 2 4 6 .... Each row contains an odd number of symbols (2*i-1), and it prints the number 2 followed by a space.
After printing all the spaces and symbols for a row, it moves to the next line (printf("\n")) to start a new row.
After printing the entire pyramid pattern, the program terminates.
In summary, this program generates a pyramid pattern of numbers, where each row contains an increasing sequence of even numbers starting from 2, with left-side alignment.

#structured_programming_basics/remainder.c
This C program calculates the remainder when one number is divided by another. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:

It prompts the user to enter two numbers.
It reads the input numbers from the user.
It calculates the remainder using the formula remainder = a - b * (a / b).
a / b calculates the integer division of a by b, giving the quotient.
b * (a / b) calculates the product of b and the quotient, which is the closest multiple of b to a.
Subtracting this product from a gives the remainder.
It prints the calculated remainder.
In summary, this program takes two numbers as input, performs the division operation, and calculates the remainder using a simple formula. Finally, it prints the result to the console.

#structured_programming_basics/reverse.c
This C program reverses an integer entered by the user. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:

It prompts the user to enter an integer.
It reads the input integer from the user.
It initializes a variable rev to store the reversed number and sets it initially to 0.
It enters a while loop that continues until the input number n becomes 0.
Inside the loop, it calculates the remainder of the input number n divided by 10 and stores it in the variable remainder.
It updates the reversed number rev by multiplying it by 10 (which shifts its digits to the left) and then adding the remainder.
It updates the input number n by performing integer division by 10, effectively removing the last digit from n.
Once the while loop completes (when n becomes 0), it prints the reversed number stored in the variable rev.
In summary, this program takes an integer as input, reverses its digits, and then prints the reversed number to the console.
